What I did:

8/1/2019: Today I read up on Linear Algebra, I got a bit through a chapter on vectors, and I will try and read more tomorrow
8/2/2019: Today I read a little bit more on vectors, and worked a bit on the Magnum Opus actually. I know it's not really the right time
but I have been documenting some of my memories that would die with me, and it's been fun. I want to keep doing this.
8/3/2019: I tried reading a little more on vectors but it is so boring and awful and I hate it, I would rather just watch Brackeys videos. I think it will be more informative and useful for what I do anyway. I also watched a little bit on sine waves and made a few more entries in the Magnum Opus. The memories just keep on coming. They don't really get any less awful.
8/4/2019: Worked on the Magnum Opus a little bit, I should have started earlier
8/5/2019: Did some cleanup with See no Evil, got some work ahead of me.
8/6/2019: Worked on See no Evil and did a bit of memories in the Magnum Opus
8/7/2019: Did some bug fixing on See no Evil
8/8/2019: Did more fixing with the time manipulation in See no Evil
8/9/2019: Did more bug fixing with See no Evil
8/10/2019: Did See no Evil fixes

8/12/2019: Went to the gym and then fell asleep when I tried to do some work
8/13/2019: Worked on the DD essay more
8/14/2019: Made a rough draft of the DD essay, will be cleaning up
8/15/2019: Rewrote some more of the DD essay and polished (Sanitarium and the 11th hour)
8/16/2019: Finished the final draft of the DD essay and submitted it for review
8/17/2019: I spent a lot of the day bonding with friends and family alike, and in a way that is just as important as anything I can do to improve my knowledge
8/18/2019: I spent the entire day in Brooklyn helping Jordan move in
8/19/2019: Looked a little bit into Visual Studio to learn some more tricks and familiarize myself with it
