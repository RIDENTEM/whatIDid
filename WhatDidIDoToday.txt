What I did:

8/1/2019: Today I read up on Linear Algebra, I got a bit through a chapter on vectors, and I will try and read more tomorrow
8/2/2019: Today I read a little bit more on vectors, and worked a bit on the Magnum Opus actually. I know it's not really the right time
but I have been documenting some of my memories that would die with me, and it's been fun. I want to keep doing this.
8/3/2019: I tried reading a little more on vectors but it is so boring and awful and I hate it, I would rather just watch Brackeys videos. I think it will be more informative and useful for what I do anyway. I also watched a little bit on sine waves and made a few more entries in the Magnum Opus. The memories just keep on coming. They don't really get any less awful.
8/4/2019: Worked on the Magnum Opus a little bit, I should have started earlier
