What I did:

8/1/2019: Today I read up on Linear Algebra, I got a bit through a chapter on vectors, and I will try and read more tomorrow
8/2/2019: Today I read a little bit more on vectors, and worked a bit on the Magnum Opus actually. I know it's not really the right time
but I have been documenting some of my memories that would die with me, and it's been fun. I want to keep doing this.
8/3/2019: I tried reading a little more on vectors but it is so boring and awful and I hate it, I would rather just watch Brackeys videos. I think it will be more informative and useful for what I do anyway. I also watched a little bit on sine waves and made a few more entries in the Magnum Opus. The memories just keep on coming. They don't really get any less awful.

9/21/2019: Worked all day on the materials for the curriculum and tried a voiceover and went 20 minutes and didn't finish
9/22/2019: Worked on the Game-U curriculum test again. I have a decent take of the animation controls, now I am working on another one for programming and will send both to the guy at the end to prove my dedication to the assignment
9/23/2019: Finished up the teaching material for Game-U, now we wait
9/24/2019: Looked into some more UE stuff, not really absorbing the information
9/25/2019: I learned that Joe got dropped from colleges because he didn't do homework because he has trouble focusing
9/26/2019: Worked on the Magnum Opus, made a couple of memories and a little story
9/27/2019: Setup Chronos finally on the infinity stones project and started work on that again
9/28/2019: Did some sexy refactoring and putting the time stone stuff in it's own class because of Chronos things
9/30/2019: Yesterday and today worked on the time manipulation stuff and started adding some UI feedback elements to make checking what powers are in use easier, mainly just using text
10/1/2019: Worked on the infinity prototype, did a ton of refactoring with the input functionality and abstracted it into it's own script away from all the infinity power stuff. Definitely used that word right
10/2/2019: Worked on the magnum opus and added a few memories and dialogue
10/3/2019: wORKed on the visual feedback for the stones and added a little bit of lighting effects to make them look good
10/4/2019: Today I worked on vfx and some time code on the infinity prototype
10/5/2019: Today I did some refactoring, solved bugs, and added some new powers to the infinity prototype and finally got the time manipulation to work for real, just need to tweak and polish it as needed
10/6/2019: Jotted down a few memories and wrote some more story for the Magnum Opus and wrote a little bit of design
10/7/2019: Moved a little bit of code around in the infinity prototype since the space stone has a power that isn't raycasted, and also worked on the UE4 throwback and got some grab ability to function through blueprinting
10/8/2019: Worked on the UE4 throwback game got the throwing to work now I need to work on the collider to throw the ball back
10/9/2019: Worked with UE4 blueprints some more, got the ball to get thrown back over the wall but not at the angle I currently want
10/10/2019: Today I worked on researching multiplayer in UE4 and put in a little bit into the project
10/11/2019: Worked on multiplayer prep for the throwback, need to research more UE4 basics
10/12/2019: Forgot to update, worked more on the UE4 multiplayer stuff, reserached replication and got it to work sort of in the game but the client side player's projectile spawning doesn't seem to work correctly
10/13/2019: Fixing a bug with the networking stuff, not sure what is going on but the spawn point for the ball still won't rotate on the player gun for the client
10/14/2019: Still working on a fix for the UE4 networking stuff, I feel like I am closer to what the actual problem is but I found that the gun doesn't rotate for the client. Also, the camera and sphere values do not change for the client at all, but somehow they can still look around
10/15/2019: Today I just did a little bit of research, not a full hours worth I was too busy moving things and then i went to the gym for a bit
10/16/2019: Today I mostly did moving and got distracted by Kitchen Nightmares and hotel hell, I tried to do a little bit of multiplayer research for UE4 but didn't get very far
10/17/2019: Did a little more multiplayer research today but not much. It looks like static meshes that are manipulated with a physics handle can't be replicated unless they already have a blueprint on them, but that doesn't sound right
10/18/2019 - 10/20/2019: Did nothing, mostly focused on moving-related tasks
10/21/2019: Looked a bit more into multiplayer stuff with UE4, turns out an actor needs to be blueprinted to open up more replication options
10/22/2019: Worked on the Magnum Opus, jotting down memories and a tiny bit of story
10/23/2019: Worked on story for the Magnum Opus today and made a memory

10/28/2019: Worked on the Magnum Opus and storyboarding
10/30/2019: Jotted down memories for the Magnum Opus
10/31/2019: Worked on an elevator pitch for the Magnum Opus, and drew another bit of design in the notebook
11/1/2019: Worked a bit on the elevator pitch
11/2/2019: Worked a little bit on the throwback, changed the grab point for the ball, and worked a bit with the level
11/3/2019: Did a little work with UI in UE4 for the throwback, I need to figure outhow to search up a server and then take input in a text box and use it too
11/4/2019: Did some work on the ui for throwback
11/5/2019: Watched a super long tutorial for multiplayer, didn't implement anything it was so boring but I gotta follow it
11/6/2019: Followed along with the multiplayer tutorial for the UE4 throwback project, got the game instance ready. For the next few days though I will be researching Pico-8 games and how to make them, since I have decided to join the tweetTweet jam starting soon
11/7/2019: Bought Pico-8 and began researching how it works, got through a tutorial game and looked through the documentation. I am just going to keep going through the Lua-specific portions of it and what keywords are used to create games
11/8/2019: Started learning Pcio-8 and a bit of Lua syntax to get prepared for the TweetTweet jam
11/9/2019: Read up more on Pico-8 and started typing up a bit of code to prepare for the jam
11/10/19: Researched more on Pico8 and got something I was working on for awhile to work correctly. The first step of many
11/11/19: Today I got input working for the TweetTweetJam entry I have going, next I need to get the obstacles rotating and then collision working and I should have the game finished albeit going over the char count
11/12/19: Got the rotation working for the obstacles
11/13/19: Worked on collision and got that sort of working
11/14/19: Wored on various improvements for the jumper jam game, there are a few glaring bugs I need to take care of including collision, the endgame, and maybe improvements with the score
11/15/19: Redid the collision, it looks like getting the pixel color won't work because of the line moving too fast and skipping pixels, so I am trying to figure out some math to calculate when the player is within the bounds of the previous frame x and current x
11/16/19: Worked more on the collision and figured out a much better way of doing it, somehow it took me two days to figure it out but it's in and it works completely and correctly. Now I have to cut down the char count by 1000
11/17/19: Worked most of the day on finishing collision for windmill and refactoring the code. It took a long time, but I made it to just 559 characters using every letter of the alphabet
11/18/19: Went back to work on the throwback, as soon as I am done with that I can move onto a different project. For today all I did was some menu stuff
11/19/19: Added some UI for the menu, and deleted the duplicate copy of the project and took the work I did previously. 
11/20/19: Redid the game instance 
11/21/19: Got the menu done, lobby scene doesn't load because there is no lobby
11/22/19: Did a bit of work on the throwback setup some more UI
11/23/19: Started work on a new game jam the oneButton jam, gonna be working in Pico8
11/24/19: Worked a bit more on the climber game for the one button jam, started focusing too much on visuals before getting the base of the gameplay down first
11/25/19: Made some progress on movement and collision, still doesn't work quite how I want it to but it's at least something
11/26/19: Worked more on the collision and jumping, I got something decent now I just have to solve a problem with the jumping and maybe rework the collision. I made a little bit of art for the mountain too, and I have an idea of how to do obstacles
11/27/19: Worked on collision and obstacles. barely got the physics working i just need to tweak it
11/28/19: Worked on collision, the obstacle appears to collide well with the player
11/29/19: Worked on finishing touches to the game and published. That's two jams down, and the game plays alright for what it is
11/30/19: Looked a bit into VBA and powerpoint to see if I should join the jam for it tomorrow
12/1/19: Started the jam and came up with an idea
12/2/19: Worked more on the jam and learned how collisions and events work in powerpoint
12/3/19: Checked out some animations and looked into a timer system for the game
12/4/19: Worked on the gameplay, can now complete a level and die
12/5/19: Finished up the final level and worked on the menu loop. Need to think about adding some flair, art or sfx
12/6/19: Remade all the level obstacles because there was some issue with the hyperlinks, my guess was it had something to do with the storyboarded shape I made originally, so I just made three different ones instead. Also did a bit of VBA
12/7/19: Finished the donut game and worked on finishing tweaks and publishing
12/8/19: Looked into what could be causing the ios problem fro Pico8 and I can't tell what it could be without an i device in front of me. Also got soundtoys working
12/9/19: Got back into the infinity stones, and took a look at making a new shader for reality. I have a better idea of what I am doing as opposed to before after reading all those documents on shaders in the past
12/10/19: Did a little more work with the shader
12/11/19: Worked on the shader and got it to work, revealing objects within the radius of a sphere, give or take a few units
12/12/19: Just wrote a bit of code to expand the reality sphere radius
12/13/19: Started a repo and art for climber
12/14/19: Worked more on art and did audio for about 10 seconds before realizing it sounded amazing
12/15/19: Did a ton of stuff with FGGS and a bit of work with audio on climber, not enough to commit anything worthwhile
12/16/19: Today I watched more FGGS lectures and took some notes
12/17/19: Worked with fggs and a bit of pico8
12/18/19: Worked on the climber and mainly worked with trying to understand how the camera works
12/19/19: Worked on the camera again and got it to follow the player and the mountain to reorient based on player position
